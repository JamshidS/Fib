# Fib
program for fibonacci series
* a is the first term of the series
* b is the second term of the series
* c is the third term of the series

## I use for loop to walk throw the series given terms you can use also while loop.

`java
c = a+b;
a=b;
b=c;
`
in the beginning a = 0 and b = 1 according to the rule of the Fib series a+b = c..
so for solving problem we should switch the values of the variables like as you see in the code.
